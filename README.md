A Smart CCTV Camera is an intelligent surveillance device designed for enhanced monitoring and security. It features a continuous recording system, ensuring that all activity within its range is captured and stored for real-time or later review. With a passerby capturing function, it takes images of individuals as they move through monitored areas, providing clear documentation for security purposes. This system also offers a customizable motion detection feature, allowing users to define a specific area of interest. When movement is detected in this selected region, the system sends alerts, helping focus attention on critical areas. This smart technology supports proactive security management, enabling immediate responses to potential incidents.
